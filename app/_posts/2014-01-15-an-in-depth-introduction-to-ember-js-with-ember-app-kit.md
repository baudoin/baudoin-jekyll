I've decided to use [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit) from [Stefan Penner](https://github.com/stefanpenner) as a foundation to learning Ember.js. Recently I followed the tutorial [An In-Depth Introduction To Ember.js](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/07/an-in-depth-introduction-to-ember-js/) by [Julien Knebel](https://twitter.com/julienknebel) but had a few hurdles in getting through it using EAK. I've completed the simple tutorial and posted the result for anyone interested in seeing the minor differences when setting up the model, route, and controller components.
